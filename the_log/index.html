  <p class="page-description" id="gfnm">This was the log I kept while developing the game. It was meant as a way to keep track of the progress of the development of Gumdrop Attack. These were suppose to be short and quick logs of what I did or was happening that day. I've gone through them to clean up any misspells or other major grammar issues. <i>These are not formal writing!</i></p>
